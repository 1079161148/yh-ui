# Introduction

## What is YH-UI?

YH-UI is a modern enterprise-level component library built on **Vue 3.5+**. It not only draws inspiration from the best design practices of leading community libraries but also strives for extreme **high performance** and **high scalability** in its architecture.

We are committed to providing developers with a UI solution that is **visually premium, functional-driven, and deeply adapted for Nuxt 3**, helping teams rapidly build production-grade web applications.

## 🌟 Core Advantages

### ⚡ Extreme Performance and Lightweight
- **Native Tree Shaking**: Built on ES Modules to ensure minimal production build size.
- **On-demand Loading**: Use individual components without importing the entire package.
- **Modern Architecture**: Take full advantage of Vue 3.5+ reactivity optimizations (e.g., `shallowRef`, `computed` optimizations) to reduce memory footprint.

### 🎨 Modern Aesthetics and Minimalist Depth
- **Comprehensive CSS Variables**: Based on the `--yh-*` variable system, supporting **millisecond-level runtime theme switching**.
- **BEM Naming Convention**: Strict style naming conventions to ensure zero conflicts in complex projects.
- **Advanced Animations**: Built-in, carefully-tuned micro-interaction animations to enhance the tactile feel of user operations.

### 🧩 Developer Experience (DX)
- **Nuxt 3 Official-level Adaptation**: Built-in modules provide zero-configuration SSR support.
- **Functional Programming**: Pursuit of high cohesion and low coupling for clear and maintainable component logic.
- **Full TypeScript Support**: Strict type definitions make the compiler your first line of defense.

### 🌍 Production Ready
- **Unit Test Coverage**: Core logic is rigorously tested with Vitest.
- **Continuous Integration**: Strict coding standards and automated check pipelines.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Deeply integrated i18n solution with support for dynamic language switching.

## 🏗️ Design Philosophy

> **"Minimalist but not simple, flexible but not without standards"**

1. **Composition over Inheritance**: Use Composition API to reduce component complexity.
2. **Data-Driven**: Follow immutable data flow principles for predictable state changes.
3. **Scalability First**: Provide rich slots and extension points to adapt to various edge business scenarios.

## 💻 Browser Compatibility

YH-UI is optimized for modern browsers only and does not support Internet Explorer.
